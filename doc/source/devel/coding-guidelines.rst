Enzo-E Coding Guidelines
************************

**[ This page is under development:** *last updated 2022-02-24* **]**


This page describes current coding guidelines for Enzo-E development.  It is
a working document and always open to suggestions for changes.  

-----------------------

============
Naming files
============

All Enzo-E-related files should be in the ``src/Enzo`` subdirectory of
the Enzo-E source code directory.  File names have the form
*component*\ ``_``\ *class*\ ``.[hc]pp``, where *component* is the
high-level code component (for Enzo-E code it is always "``enzo``"),
*class* is the class-name (see below for Enzo-E class naming
guidelines), and extension ``.hpp`` for header (declaration) files and
``.cpp`` for source (definition) files.

+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| File type           |  Enzo-E file name                           |
+=====================+=============================================+
| Physics method      |  ``enzo_EnzoMethod``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``   |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Linear solver       |  ``enzo_EnzoSolver``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``   |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Initial conditions  | ``enzo_EnzoInitial``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``   |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Boundary conditions | ``enzo_EnzoBoundary``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``  |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Interpolation       | ``enzo_EnzoProlong``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``   |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Restriction         | ``enzo_EnzoRestrict``\ *Name*\ ``.[hc]pp``  |
+---------------------+---------------------------------------------+

==============
Naming classes
==============

Enzo-E classes all begin with ``Enzo``, followed by the (capitalized)
general type indicating the type of Cello class ("``Method``",
"``Solver``", "``Initial``" for initial conditions, etc.), followed by
the specific name for the class type.  For example, the Conjugate
Gradient (CG) linear solver class is named ``EnzoSolverCg``.  Note
that all code implementing an Enzo-E class should (generally) live in
the files ``enzo_``\ *class-name*\ ``.hpp`` and ``enzo_``\ *class-name*\ ``.cpp``.

+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Class type          |  Enzo-E class name        | Cello base class |
+=====================+===========================+==================+
| Physics method      |  ``EnzoMethod``\ *Name*   | ``Method``       |
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Linear solver       |  ``EnzoSolver``\ *Name*   | ``solver``       |
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Initial conditions  | ``EnzoInitial``\ *Name*   | ``Initial``      |
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Boundary conditions | ``EnzoBoundary``\ *Name*  | ``Boundary``     |
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Interpolation       | ``EnzoProlong``\ *Name*   | ``Prolong``      | 
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+
| Restriction         | ``EnzoRestrict``\ *Name*  | ``Restrict``     |
+---------------------+---------------------------+------------------+

====================
Naming class methods
====================

Methods (functions associated with a specific class) are generally
named beginning with a lower-case letter, and underscores for spacing.
Public methods end in an underscore ``_``.

+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Method type                     | Method name             |
+=================================+=========================+
| public methods                  | ``a_public_thing()``    |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| private methods                 | ``a_private_thing_()``  |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Charm++ entry methods           | ``p_blah()``            |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Charm++ reduction entry methods | ``r_reduce()``          |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------+

Note that Charm entry methods have very different behavior than
regular C++ methods--they are (usually) asynchronous, return
immediately, and are called using a Charm++ proxy to a class typically
residing on a different processing element in a different memory
space.  So it's important to name entry methods in a way that they are
obviously entry methods!  See the Charm++ manual for more details.

=============================
Headers and File Organization
=============================

The Cello and Enzo layers of the codebase are both organized into subcomponents, but there are slightly different guidelines dictating the file organization.

Cello
-----

The files are all organized in a flat directory structure. Every file
is prefixed by the name of the component that it belongs to. Individual
headers are not intended to be used. Instead, each component defines 2
standard header files.

1. ``_``\ *component*\ ``.hpp``: This is a private header that is used
   to aggregate the headers for all functions/classes defined as part
   of the component.

2. *component*\ ``.hpp``: This is the public header. It contains
   includes the ``_``\ *component*\ ``.hpp``. It also contains all of
   the necessary include statements for the headers from other
   components that are necessary for the declarations/definitions
   present in the current headers (usually it includes the
   ``_``-prefixed header).

Because the directory structure is flat all include-directives just
specify filenames (there are no paths).

Enzo
----

Over the last several years, the Enzo-layer has grown significantly (it
is now comparable in size to Cello layer), and it is likely to continue
growing. Due to the large (and increasing) size of the Enzo-layer, we
take some steps to improve build-times.  We are in the midst of
rolling-out an updated policy.


Traditional Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Historically, the Enzo-layer was structured just like one of the
components in the Cello Layer in a flat structure. All individual
header files were aggregated inside of the private
``src/Enzo/_enzo.hpp`` header and there was a public header called
``src/Enzo/enzo.hpp``. The files were also originally organized in a
flat directory structure, but that is no longer the case.
Additionally, just about every source file started with:

.. code-block:: c++

   #include "cello.hpp"
   #include "enzo.hpp"

While this approach has been **very** successful and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it *per se*, it does trigger a full rebuild of the entire Enzo-layer any time any header file changes.

New Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under our new approach, the contents of the Enzo-layer are now organized into subdirectories, which corresponds to a subcomponents.
Each subcomponent has an aggregate header named after the component (e.g. the ``Enzo/mesh`` subcomponent should have an associated header called ``Enzo/mesh/mesh.hpp``).

.. note::

   Nested subdirectories are handled on a case-by-case basis.  In some
   cases, each nested subdirectory is treated as a separate
   subcomponent. In other cases, nested subdirectories are only used
   for organization-purposes.

**Unlike with the Cello layer,** there is currently no distinction between a private and public header: the aggregate header **is** the public header.
Each public header file should be self-contained.
In other words, the header should compile on its own, without requiring it to be included alongside other header files (or requiring a particular order of include-directives).

To be self-contained, each public header needs to have the necessary include directives so that all of the other aggregated headers within the public header have access to the necessary symbols.

* Within the enzo-layer, all include-directives should specify paths to relative to the ``src`` directory.
  Thus the include directives may look like:

  .. code-block:: c++

     #include "Cello/cello.hpp"
     #include "Cello/mesh.hpp"
     #include "Enzo/enzo.hpp"

  This ensures that there is no ambiguity if there are similarly named subcomponents in the Enzo- and Cello-layers.

* A public header in a given subcomponent should generally only include the public headers from other subcomponents.
  Because including the public header from another component exposes symbols beyond what is strictly necessary, we recommend adding a comment next to the include directive that specifies the name of the symbol (e.g. a class, type, function)that is required from the header.
  By doing this, future developers can more easily remove unnecessary ``#include`` directives if a particular dependency is no longer necessary OR is moved

* It is important to be mindful that include-directives introduce transitive dependencies, and any time a header file changes, all ``.cpp`` files that depend on that header (whether directly or transitively) needs to be recompiled.

* Do your best to ensure that the public header files only include what is necessary and avoid unnecessary include statements (to keep compile-times shorter).
  With that said, it's better to explicitly write out include-directives to other headers, even if that header would transitively be included by some other unrelated header.


.. note::

   In the long-term, it may make sense to make each individual header self-contained, which is the recommended strategy by the `Google C++ Style Guidelines <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Header_Files>`_

   Ideally, each header would include just the headers defining other symbols (classes/types/functions) that it needs.
   Under this approach, inclusion order would become less problematic and it would further speed up incremental compilation.
   Transitioning to this kind of approach all at once would be intractable since there are currently over 125 header files in the Enzo-layer.
   However, this alternative approach is definitely worth exploring and could be implemented on a subcomponent-by-subcomponent basis in the future.

What is actually necssary to include in a header file?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is useful to have a brief discussion about what is actually necessary to include in a header file.

As noted in the `Mozilla Style-Guide <MozillaStyleHeaders_>`_, a full definition of a type is required for the type to be used

* as a Base class,
* as a member/local variable
* in a function declaration, where an instance of the type is passed as an argument, by-value, OR is returned from the function, by value.
* with ``delete`` or ``new``
* as a template argument (in certain cases)
* if it refers to a non-scoped enum type (in all cases)
* when refering to the values of a scoped enum

The `Mozilla Style-Guide <MozillaStyleHeaders_>`_ also notes that a forward declarations of a type will suffice when the type is used

* for declaring a member/local variable that holds a reference or pointer to that type.
* in a function declaration that accepts reference or pointer to that type as an argument or returns a reference or pointer to that type.
* in the definition of a type-alias.

.. note::

   In general, there is a difference of opinion about whether forward declarations should be used.
   For example, the `Mozilla Style-Guide <MozillaStyleHeaders_>`_ and the `LLVM Style Guide <https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#include-as-little-as-possible>`_ generally encourage usage of forward declarations.
   In contrast, the `Google Style Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Forward_Declarations>`_ discourages this practice.

   We don't currently take a strong position on this.
   In the codebase's current state, there are definitely cases where using forward declarations is **VERY** useful (it may be helpful to leave a comment explaining why its useful/necessary in a particular case).

   If we do shift to making **all** header-files self-contained, it may make the codebase more readable if we avoided forward declarations in the future.
   But, we can cross that bridge, when we get to it.

Finally, it's worth noting that there is a large temptation to implement functions or a class's member-functions (aka methods) inside of the header where they are declared.
Sometimes this is unavoidable - it's necessary when defining templates and sometimes it's necessary for performance-purposes (to facilitate inlining of a function called within a tight for-loop).
However, in a lot of cases (especially when implementing a ``virtual`` method), this can and should be avoided.
This practice has a tendency to introduce additional include-directives into a header file that could otherwise just be located within a source file.

For example, a handful of functions in Enzo-E make use of functionality defined in the ``<algorithm>``, ``<random>``, and ``<sstream>`` headers without needing to pass around types defined in these headers between functions.
In these cases, by implementing such functions in ``.cpp`` files, we can directly include these headers in the ``.cpp`` source files and avoid including them in the header files (this can actually save a lot of time during compiling since standard library headers can be large).

As we finish transitioning the Enzo-layer to using separate subcomponents, additional opportunities will arise for including headers in source files rather than inside of headers.
For example, most times when you access instances of :cpp:class:`!EnzoPhysicsCosmology`, :cpp:class:`!EnzoPhysicsFluidProps`, or :cpp:class:`!GrackleChemistryData` in the method of a class, ``MyClass``, the header defining ``MyClass``, doesn't actually require knowledge about the definitions of these other classes.
Often times, a method ``MyClass`` will simply use :cpp:expr:`!enzo::cosmology()`, :cpp:expr:`!enzo::fluid_props()`, or :cpp:expr:`!enzo::grackle_chemistry()` to retrieve an instance of one of these classes.
Then the method will query a piece of information stored in the retrieved instance and it will never touch the instance again.

Questions and Answers about introducing new files to the Enzo Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**How do I add a new file to the Enzo-Layer?**

Usually you will introduce a header (``.hpp``) and source (``.cpp``) file at the same time.

1. Find an appropriate subdirectory to put the new file in.
2. *Identify the relevant aggregate header file.*
   First, check for a header file that shares the name of the current subdirectory (with a ``.hpp`` suffix).
   If that doesn't exist, check for the aggregate header file in the parent directory.
   Repeat the process until you find subdirectory has an aggregate header file (you should only really need to go up 1 level).
3. Once you find the appropriate aggregate header file, add an include statement to your header file (if there aren't include-statements to other header files in the same subdirectory, you're probably in the wrong place).
4. *Identify the relevant* ``CMakeLists.txt`` *file for other files in the current subdirectory.*
   First, check for this file in the subdirectory where you have placed your new files.
   If it doesn't exist, check the parent directory.
   Repeat the process until you find it.
5. Add the paths to your new header and source file to the existing list of other files that are located in the same subdirectory as your new files.
   (If no such list exists, but you see something about ``GLOB``, you may not need to do anything).

**How do I delete a file from the Enzo-Layer?**

This is pretty self-explanatory.
Just make sure to delete entries in the aggregate header file and (if applicable) the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file that specify the path(s) to your deleted file.

**How do I move files between subdirectories in the Enzo-Layer??**

This is also pretty easy.
Just make sure to delete the old paths from the aggregate header and the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files where they were originally listed.
And, make sure to add the new paths to the appropriate aggregate header and the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

Enzo Header Guards
------------------

To avoid issues with a header being included multiple times (i.e. if it is a transitive dependency of another header), we make use of ``#define`` header guards in every header. In general, the header guard symbol looks something like ``ENZO_<PATH>_<FILE>_HPP``, where ``<PATH>`` is replaced by the path to the file and ``<FILE>`` is the filename (excluding the ``.hpp`` suffix).

.. note::

   A number of headers have guard symbols that are unchanged from before the Enzo subdirectory was reorganized.
   As an example, ``EnzoMethodPpm`` was previously defined in ``src/Enzo/enzo_EnzoMethodPpm.hpp`` and had a header guard symbol called ``ENZO_ENZO_METHOD_PPM_HPP`` (the underscore was used as a separator between Camel-Case separated words and in place of the period``.

====================
Accessing Field data
====================

There are 2 approaches for accessing Cello Field block arrays.

  1. The traditional approach is to directly manipulate the raw pointers managed by Cello.
     These can be accessed with the ``Field::values`` method.

  2. The preferred approach is to use the ``CelloView`` multidimensional array templates that wrap the raw pointers managed by Cello.
     Using ``CelloView``\s improve code clarity and safety at the cost of very marginal losses in performance (according to benchmarks).
     ``Field::view`` is used to help facillitate this approach.
     For more details about ``CelloView``\s, see :ref:`using-CelloView`

Below, we provide a table that summarizes the suggested names for Field-related variables used to access the array elements.
We additionally provide brief descriptions of relevant ``Field`` methods.
Sample code is also included for both approaches.
In each case, the sample code initializes active zones (non-ghost zones) of the ``"density"`` field to be equal to ``0.0``.

Summary of field attributes
---------------------------

+------------------------+-----------------+
| Field-related variable | suggested names |
+========================+=================+
| Array dimensions       | ``mx,my,mz``    |
+------------------------+-----------------+
| Active region size     | ``nx,ny,nz``    |
+------------------------+-----------------+
| Ghost zone depth       | ``gx,gy,gz``    |
+------------------------+-----------------+
| Loop variables         | ``ix,iy,iz``    |
+------------------------+-----------------+

Relevant ``Field`` methods
--------------------------

The traditional approach for accessing fields relies on:

.. code-block:: c++

   char * Field::values (int id_field, int index_history=0) throw ();

This method returns the pointer to the data for the corresponding field (specified by ``id_field``). If no field can be found, this returns a ``nullptr``.
The inclusion of ghost zones is determined by whether or not they've been allocated.
While invoking this method as part of a ``Method`` object's implementation, it's fairly safe to assume that the returned array will indeed include the ghost zones.

The ``index_history`` argument is used to optionally specify the generation of field values that you want to load (higher values correspond to older generations of values).
The default value, ``0``, will give you the current generation of values (this is usually what you want).

The preferred approach for accessing fields relies upon:

.. code-block:: c++

   template<class T>
   CelloView<T,3> Field::view (int id_field,
                                ghost_choice choice = ghost_choice::include,
                                int index_history=0) throw ();

This returns a `CelloView` that acts as a view of the specified field.
The meaning of the ``id_field`` and ``index_history`` arguments are unchanged from ``Field::values``.
Unlike ``Field::values``, when an invalid ``id_field`` is specified, the program will abort with an error.

The template parameter ``T`` specifies the expected datatype of the field.
If the field does not have the expected datatype, the program will abort with an explanatory error message.
While implementing a ``Method`` object in the ``Enzo`` layer, this parameter is frequently ``enzo_float``.

By default, the returned ``CelloView`` **always** include ghost zones.
This behavior is controlled by the ``choice`` argument, which can be passed the following values:

  * ``ghost_choice::include``: the returned view always includes ghost zones (the program aborts with an error message if ghost zones aren't allocated). This is the default value.
  * ``ghost_choice::exclude``: the returned view always excludes ghost zones.
  * ``ghost_choice::permit``: the returned view includes ghost zones if they are allocated (replicating the behavior of ``Field::values``).

Overloads are also provided for ``Field::values`` and ``Field::view`` that:
  * provide read-only access to field arrays from a ``const Field`` instance
  * let you replace the first argument with a string holding the field's name

Sample code for clearing active density zones
---------------------------------------------

Traditional Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c++

   Field field = cello::field();
   int id = field.field_id("density");
   int mx, my, mz;
   field.dimensions (id, &mx, &my, &mz);
   int gx, gy, gz;
   field.ghost_depth(id, &gx, &gy, &gz);

   enzo_float * d = (enzo_float *) field.values(id);

   for (int iz=gz; iz<mz-gz; iz++) {
     for (int iy=gy; iy<my-gy; iy++) {
       for (int ix=gx; ix<my-gx; ix++) {
         int i = ix + mx*(iy + my*iz);
         d[i] = 0.0;
       }
     }
   }

Preferred Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shorter version of the following snippet is also possible where we pass ``ghost_choice::exclude`` as the second argument to ``field.view`` to entirely exclude the ghost zone from the array.

.. code-block:: c++

   Field field = cello::field();
   int id = field.field_id("density");
   int gx, gy, gz;
   field.ghost_depth(id, &gx, &gy, &gz);

   CelloView<enzo_float,3> d = field.view<enzo_float>(id);

   // we can get the array shape directly from the array (a minor design quirk
   // may make the arguments for the shape method seem a little unintuitive)
   int mz = d.shape(0);
   int my = d.shape(1);
   int mx = d.shape(2);

   for (int iz=gz; iz<mz-gz; iz++) {
     for (int iy=gy; iy<my-gy; iy++) {
       for (int ix=gx; ix<my-gx; ix++) {
         d(iz, iy, ix) = 0.0;
       }
     }
   }

More code examples that use this functionallity can be found in the implementation of the ``EnzoInitialCloud`` and ``EnzoInitialBCenter`` classes

Accessing Particles
===================

===================
Preprocessor Macros
===================

In case you add a new preprocessor macro or definition that is being used in a ``.ci`` file,
you have to add it to the ``CHARM_PREPROC_DEFS`` list in the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` so that
it is being used/forwarded when processing the ``.ci`` files.

For example, for Grackle we set
``set(CHARM_PREPROC_DEFS ${CHARM_PREPROC_DEFS} "-DCONFIG_USE_GRACKLE ")``, which appends to the
existing list of defintions alredy stored in the ``CHARM_PREPROC_DEFS`` variable.
